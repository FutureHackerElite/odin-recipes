    <ol>
      <li>Arrange oven shelf to the middle of your oven. Preheat oven to broil/grill settings on medium heat.</li>
      <li>Season salmon with salt, pepper, paprika and lemon pepper. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Heat the butter in a skillet or pan over medium-high heat until melted.
      Add the garlic and saut√© for about a minute, until fragrant. Pour in the honey, water
      and soy sauce; allow the flavours to heat through and combine.
      Add in the lemon juice; stir well to combine all of the flavours together.</li>
      <li>Add the salmon steaks to the sauce in the pan;
      cook each fillet (skin-side down if there's any skin) for 3-4 minutes or until golden,
      while basting the tops with the pan juices.</li>
      <li>Optional -- Add the lemon wedges around the salmon
      (adds a stronger lemon taste).</li>
      <li>Baste salmon one more time then transfer salmon steaks to a pan (make sure you save all the sauce for later),
      then set your oven to broil / grill for a further 5-6 minutes,
      or until the tops of the salmon are nicely charred,
      and the salmon is cooked to your liking.</li>
      <li>To serve, drizzle with the sauce and a squeeze of lemon juice.
      Serve with steamed vegetables; over rice or with a salad.(to make your meal even better drizzle your rice with the
      sauce you'll thank me later also if you want to know what kind of rice check out this link</li>
      <li>make your meal ten times by drizzling the leftover sauce on the salmon and some rice. (you'll thank me later)
